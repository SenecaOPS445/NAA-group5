# Fall 2024 Assignment 2
For this Assignment we are going to be making a script for System Reports and Metrics. In this script it will ask the user what they want to see on their computer for information to be displayed. The user will also be provided with options of what they wanna see at the moment. These options can be CPU, Memory, and DISK usages. This program will use functions with lines of code that will be called based on the choice the user inputs into as an option.This information will be presented into the terminal with possibly other options to work off of the one the user had already chosen. The options that will be included are CPU, MEM, or DISK usage options. The most challenging part might be trying to get the correct code in the script for it to be able to all work together without having any issue. I also think that finding the right commands as well might be a challenge for this assignment.
